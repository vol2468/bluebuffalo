# IoT Air Quality Dashboard

## Description

This website will display historical air quality information for US cities from the year 2000 to 2021, through graphs. The website will track the pollutants Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone, and Sulphur Dioxide (CO, NO2, O3, SO2). This will serve to inform the public about the increasing pollution in US cities and hopefully make them more aware of not only their individual impact, but of the collective impact of the industries they support. This information could also be shown to school children to make them aware of the rapidly changing world they inhabit and the potential threats that come with the status quo livestyle of the US general population.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
